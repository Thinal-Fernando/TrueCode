# 🧑‍💻TrueCode – Real-Time Coding Interview & Practice Platform


**TrueCode** is a full-stack web platform designed to help developers **practice coding interviews together in real time**. It allows friends, interviewers, or recruiters to create interview sessions where participants can **solve coding problems collaboratively while communicating through video, chat, and a shared code editor**.

The platform simulates a **real technical interview environment**, enabling users to practice solving problems, discuss solutions, and receive immediate feedback on their code.

Users can either:
- Upload their own coding questions
- Select a programming language and solve problems
- Input interview questions manually
- Upload a CV to generate interview-style questions

TrueCode aims to make **technical interview preparation interactive and realistic**.
